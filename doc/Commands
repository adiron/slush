How does adding commands work?

Commands are stored in the dictionary "commands" in data/commands.py.

It works in the following manner:

	def cmd_goto(session, args, database):
		session.send(...)
		
	commands = { ["go"] : cmd_goto }
	
session	 - the session of the command's issuer.
args	 - the arguments passed on to the command.
database - slush database.
