The db object can indeed be a bit frustrating to use for some. And so I'm
writing this guide to make others' lives a bit easier.

For a start, I'll show you some examples. Initializing a SlushTable object:

	from lib import db
	a = db.SlushTable("phonebook.db", "contacts", ["name", "phone"])
	
This will create "a", a table called "contacts" inside of the file
"phonebook.db" with two columns. Actually 3, if you include "idx".

You can iterate on the object just as a normal dictionary or list. It behaves
in the same manner.

Another thing. Suppose "data" is SlushTable object:
	b = data[5]
b will actually become a pointer to that row. So any changes made TO b will be
reflected in the DB.

NOTE: iterating upon a SlushTable will NOT change it.
	for a in data:
		a["age"] = a["age"] + 10
		
Will have no effect on "data". However:
	for a in data:
		data[a["idx"]] = data[a["idx"]] + 10
Will change it.

To add a new row:
	a.append( {"name": "Whatever", "phone": "555-666-777"} )
	
Remember: the dict must satisfy ALL of the table's 

EXAMPLES:
	>>> a.append({ "name": "Adi", "phone": "555-666-777"})
	>>> a
	idx | name | phone
	1 | 'Adi' | '555-666-777'

	>>> a[1]
	{'phone': '555-666-777', 'name': 'Adi', 'idx': 1}
	>>> a[1]["name"] = "Dushkin"
	>>> a[1]
	{'phone': '555-666-777', 'name': 'Dushkin', 'idx': 1}
