The db object can indeed be a bit frustrating to use for some. And so I'm writing this guide
to make others' lives a bit easier.

For a start, I'll show you some examples. Initializing a SlushTable object:

	from lib import db
	a = db.SlushTable("phonebook.db", "contacts", ["name", "phone"])
	
This will create "a", a table called "contacts" inside of the file "phonebook.db" with two
columns. Actually 3, if you include "idx".

You can iterate on the object just as a normal dictionary or list. It behaves in the same
manner.

Another thing. Suppose "data" is SlushTable object:

	b = data[5]
	
b will actually become a pointer to that row. So any changes made TO b will be reflected
in the DB.
